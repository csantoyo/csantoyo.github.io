  abstract={This paper studies the problem of enforcing safetyof  a  stochastic  dynamical  system  over  a  finite  
  time  horizon.We  use  stochastic  barrier  functions  as  a  means  to  quantify the  probability  that  a  system  exits  a  
  given  safe  region  of  thestate  space  in  finite  time.  A  barrier  certificate  condition  thatbounds  the  infinitesimal  
  generator  of  the  system,  and  hencebounds the expected value of the barrier function over the time horizon,  is  recast  as  
  a  sum-of-squares  optimization  problemfor  efficient  numerical  computation.  Unlike  prior  works,  theproposed certificate 
  condition includes a state-dependent boundon  the  infinitesimal  generator,  allowing  for  tighter  probabilitybounds.  Moreover,  
  for  stochastic  systems  for  which  the  driftdynamics  are  affine-in-control,  we  propose  a  method  for  syn-thesizing  polynomial  
  state  feedback  controllers  that  achieve  aspecified  probability  of  safety.  Two  case  studies  are  presentedthat benchmark and illustrate 
  the performance of our method.}
