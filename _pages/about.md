I'm a graduate student at Georgia Tech's School of Electrical Engineering advised by Prof. Sam Coogan in the Formal Methods & Autonomous Control of Transportation Systems (FACTS) Lab. My research interests are autonomy, game theory, robotics, space exploration & stochastic systems.

In addition to research, I enjoy cycling, running, and tinkering with hobby electronics. I'm an avid reader of non-fiction literature including books and essays on space policy, economics, and history.
