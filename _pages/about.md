I'm a Ph.D. student at Georgia Tech's School of Electrical & Computer Engineering in Atlanta, GA. My advisor is Prof. Sam Coogan of the Formal Methods & Autonomous Control of Transportation Systems (FACTS) Lab. I earned my Bachelor of Science in Aerospace Engineering with a minor in Mathematics from the University of Florida, Gainesville, FL. Furthermore, I recently completed my Master of Science in Electrical & Computer Engineering from Georgia Tech. My current research interests are autonomy, controls, machine learning, optimization, stochastic systems, specifically with applications to robotics, space exploration, and electric vehicle charging.

In addition to research, I enjoy cycling, running, hiking, and tinkering with hobby electronics. My favorite hobby is sampling the diverse cuisines offered by restaurants along [Georgia's Buford Highway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buford_Highway).
