I'm a gradute student at Georgia Tech's School of Electrical & Computer Engineering currently advised by Prof. Sam Coogan. I received my Bachelors of Science in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Florida with a minor in mathematics. My current research interests are autonomy, game theory, robotics, space exploration & stochastic systems.

Outside of research, I enjoy cycling, running, and tinkering with hobby electronics. I'm an avid reader of non-fiction books and essays related to space policy, economics, finance, and history.
