I'm currently a software engineer at Aurora Innovation. I earned my Ph.D. from Georgia Tech's School of Electrical & Computer Engineering in Atlanta, GA under the supervision of Prof. Sam Coogan. I earned my Bachelor of Science in Aerospace Engineering with a minor in Mathematics from the University of Florida, Gainesville, FL. My research interests are in controls, machine learning, optimization, and stochastic systems, specifically with applications to autonomous systems and queuing systems such as charging stations. I'm particuarly interested in the application of machine learning algorithms to safety critical applications and the verification of such methods. 

In addition to research, I enjoy cycling, running, hiking, and tinkering with hobby electronics.
