My research interests are in controls, stochastic systems, optimization, and machine learning with applications to electric vehicle charging and autonomous systems.


## Analysis and Control of Stochastic Systems
 <!-- <img src="/images/projects/cs7643.png" alt="cs7643" class="image"> -->
Stochastic systems are systems that experience or exhibit random behavior. Such systems are ubiquitous in real-world applications such as underwater robotics, resource management, traffic networks, and financial markets, among others. The randomness of stochastic systems makes them challenging to understand, analyze, and control; however, this difficulty highlights the importance of studying such systems.

I'm generally interested in the <strong> <i> analysis and control </i></strong> of stochastic systems. On the analysis front, I'm interested in developing computationally efficient tools for the safety verification of stochastic systems. Frequently, it is also important to develop control algorithms that compute control actions that achieve the desired objective with high probability. 

## Electric Vehicle Charging 
Mobility is contemporaneously undergoing seismic changes stemming from evolving technologies that are fundamentally altering the way we transport people and goods. A notable example of such changes is the increased adoption of non-internal combustion engine vehicles, specifically electric vehicles (EVs). This is catalyzed by improved affordability of EVs which is reflected in the conclusions of [recent studies](https://about.bnef.com/electric-vehicle-outlook/) that forecast that global new vehicle sales in 2040 will be 58% EVs and the global passenger vehicle market will be 31% electric. The EV revolution promises to transform transportation and mobility while having consequential effects on global energy and transportation infrastructure. With the growing number of EVs, the demands on the  EV charging ecosystem (EVCE), i.e., charging facilities, charging schedulers, utility providers, etc., will be greater.

Many aspects of the EVCE are stochastic, i.e., random, in nature, since many of the interactions that occur amongst the entities that comprise the EVCE are nondeterministic. This poses a variety of challenges for both customers and charging facility operators. I'm particularly interested in developing probabilistic techniques for EV charging facility operation using techniques from <strong> <i> optimization, control theory, machine learning, and queueing theory</i></strong>.
